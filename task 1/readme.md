let obj1 = {
  name: "Person",
  age: 5,
}; // creating object 1

let obj2 = {
  age: 5,
  name: "Person",
}; // creating object 2

if (obj1 === obj2) {  // comparing data without changing order
  
  console.log(" Both are Same! ");
} else {
  
  console.log(" Both are Different!");
}

// both object has same property only but in this method it will return a value as false so both are diff.

// this data is in jsobject so we have to convert into JSON, using stringify() method we can convert JSObject into JSON.
